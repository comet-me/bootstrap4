        My name is Romeo Bulalacao Jr. I am very much interested in applying for the <span id="jobTitle">[Job Title]</span> post.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
    I had worked in a corporate company before, and my job responsibilities there were more on technical support. Back then, when I started learning and discovering new things, I discover that I can make my reports 10x faster without compromising accuracy.</p>
    <p>Since then, I began to love coding and learning new languages. I have so many things that I learned outside this company because I pushed myself to where should I be. My hard work taught me how to use the following applications that we didn’t use in this company: Power BI, MySQL, SAP, Macro (Excel), MS Access, PHP, and other platforms for making a website</p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The most significant experience that I consider also as my strength is that whenever I put my mind to a certain task where I need to learn something, that’s where I become more competitive. I believe 101 percent that I am a teachable person. I always look for innovation for the company as well as my learning curves to support my skill so that I can keep providing the most client needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you give me a chance, it will really be a privilege to apply my skills and years of experience and grow with your company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please see the attached file for my resume. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am open to having an interview at your most convenient time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hoping for your consideration,
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Truly Yours,</p>
    <br>
